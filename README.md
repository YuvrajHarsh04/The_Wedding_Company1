## Assumptions Made
The quiz does not require backend integration; all questions are static and stored locally.
No authentication or user account system is needed.
Accessibility is partially implemented but not fully WCAG compliant due to assignment time constraints.
Deployment is handled through Vercel, which supports Next.js natively.
The assignment expects animation quality and UI design as a key evaluation factor.
